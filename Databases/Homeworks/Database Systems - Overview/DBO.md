# Database Systems

1. What database models do you know? 
	-  Hierarchical model
	-  Network model
	-  Object-oriented database models
	-  Relational model
1. Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)? 
	- A relational DBMS is special system software that is used to manage the organization, storage, access, security and integrity of data.  This specialized software allows application systems to focus on the user interface, data validation and screen navigation.  When there is a need to add, modify, delete or display data, the application system simply makes a "call" to the RDBMS.

1. Define what is "table" in database terms.
	- A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns), and rows.
	- A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows.
	-  Each row is identified by one or more values appearing in a particular column subset. 

1. Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.
	-  **Primary key**  - The columns subset which uniquely identifies a row.
	-  **Foreign key** -  is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.

1. Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.
	-  **One-to-many** - The primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one, or many records in the related table. This relationship is similar to the one between you and a parent. You have only one mother, but your mother may have several children.
	-  **Many-to-many** - Each record in both tables can relate to any number of records (or no records) in the other table. For instance, if you have several siblings, so do your siblings (have many siblings). Many-to-many relationships require a third table, known as an associate or linking table, because relational systems can't directly accommodate the relationship.
	-  **One-to-one** - Both tables can have only one record on either side of the relationship. Each primary key value relates to only one (or no) record in the related table. They're like spousesâ€”you may or may not be married, but if you are, both you and your spouse have only one spouse. Most one-to-one relationships are forced by business rules and don't flow naturally from the data. In the absence of such a rule, you can usually combine both tables into one table without breaking any normalization rules.

1. When is a certain database schema normalized?
	-  Database normalization is the process of organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a relational database to minimize data redundancy. Database schema is normalized when all repeating data is related with foreign key to other tables.

1. What are the advantages of normalized databases?
	- eliminating redundant data (for example, storing the same data in more than one table)
	-  ensuring data dependencies make sense (only storing related data in a table)
	-  Both of these are worthy goals as they reduce the amount of space a database consumes and ensure that data is logically stored.

1. What are database integrity constraints and when are they used? -
	- **Domain Integrity** - Domain integrity means the definition of a valid set of values for an attribute. You define: data type, lenght or size, is null value allowed, is the value unique or non for an attribute. You may also define the default value, the range (values in between) and/or specific values for the attribute. Some DBMS allow you to define the output format and/or input mask for the attribute. These definitions ensure that a specific attribute will have a right and proper value in the database.
	- **Entity Integrity Constraint** - The entity integrity constraint states that primary keys can't be null. There must be a proper value in the primary key field. This is because the primary key value is used to identify individual rows in a table. If there were null values for primary keys, it would mean that we could not indentify those rows. On the other hand, there can be null values other than primary key fields. Null value means that one doesn't know the value for that field. Null value is different from zero value or space.
	- **Referential Integrity Constraint** - The referential integrity constraint is specified between two tables and it is used to maintain the consistency among rows between the two tables.
The rules are:
		1. You can't delete a record from a primary table if matching records exist in a related table.
		2. You can't change a primary key value in the primary table if that record has related records.
		3. You can't enter a value in the foreign key field of the related table that doesn't exist in the primary key of the primary table.
		4. However, you can enter a Null value in the foreign key, specifying that the records are unrelated.
	- **Foreign Key Integrity Constraint** - There are two foreign key integrity constraints: cascade update related fields and cascade delete related rows. These constraints affect the referential integrity constraint.	
		- **Cascade Update Related Fields** - Any time you change the primary key of a row in the primary table, the foreign key values are updated in the matching rows in the related table. This constraint overrules rule 2 in the referential integrity constraints. 
		- **Cascade Delete Related Rows** - Any time you delete a row in the primary table, the matching rows are automatically deleted in the related table. This constraint overrules rule 1 in the referential integrity constraints.  

1. Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database -  Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed.
	- Indices speed up searching of values in a certain column or group of columns
	- Usually implemented as B-trees
	- Indices can be built-in the table (clustered) or stored externally (non-clustered)
	- Adding and deleting records in indexed tables is slower!
	- Indices should be used for big tables only (e.g. 50 000 rows)

1. What's the main purpose of the SQL language? - SQL is designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
1. What are transactions used for? - Transactions are a sequence of database operations which are executed as a single unit:
	- Either all of them execute successfully
	- Or none of them is executed at all

1. Give an example. - A bank transfer from one account into another (withdrawal + deposit). If either the withdrawal or the deposit fails the entire operation should be cancelled

1. What is a NoSQL database? - A NoSQL (originally referring to "non SQL" or "non relational" [1]) database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this approach include: simplicity of design, simpler "horizontal" scaling to clusters of machines, which is a problem for relational databases, and finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, graph, or document) differ slightly from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL and others faster in relational databases. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by noSQL databases are also viewed as "more flexible" than relational database tables.

1. Explain the classical non-relational data models.
   - Document model - Set of documents, e.g. JSON strings
  - Key-value model - Set of key-value pairs
  - Hierarchical key-value - Hierarchy of key-value pairs
  - Wide-column model - Key-value model with schema
  - Object model - Set of OOP-style objects

1. Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
	- **Redis** - Ultra-fast in-memory data structures server
	- **MongoDB** - Mature and powerful JSON-document database
	- **CouchDB** - JSON-based document database with REST API
	- **Cassandra** - Distributed wide-column database

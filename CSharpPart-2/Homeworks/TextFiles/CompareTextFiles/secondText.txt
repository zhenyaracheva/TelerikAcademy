Green ship

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of ship

So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our green ship

We all live in a green ship
Green submarine, green ship
We all live in a green ship
Green ship, green ship

And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a green ship
Green ship, green ship
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
One line bonus.

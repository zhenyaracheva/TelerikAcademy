Some te_xt editors small and simple, while others offer broad and complex functions. 
For example, Unix and Unix-like operating systems have the pico editor (or a variant), but many also include the 
Emacs editor. Microsoft Windows systems come with the simple Notepad, though many people�especially programmers�prefer 
other editors with more features. Under Macintosh's classic Mac OS there was the native SimpleText, which was 
in Mac OS X by TextEdit, which combines features of a text editor with those typical of a word processor 
such as rulers, margins and multiple font selection. These features are not available simultaneously, but must be 
switched by user command, or through the program automatically determining the file testtype.
